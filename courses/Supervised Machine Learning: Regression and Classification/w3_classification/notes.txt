-> Classification:
	- Find classes or categories
	- Linear regression can be used but works poorly
	
	- Logistic regression:
		- Sigmoid function (logistic function)
			"probability" that class is 1
			
			g(z) = 1 / (1 + e^-z)
			0 < g(z) < 1
			
			z = w(arrow) . x(arrow) + b	-> found via linear regression
		
		- Cost function for logistic regression
			RSS doesn't work cause the cause function it is non-convex
			
			sum of logistic loss function
			
			loss =  { if y(i) = 1	->	loss = -log(f_wb(x))
			 	{ if y(i) = 0	->	loss = -log(1 - f_wb(x)
			 	
			 joining the two functions into one:
			 
			 loss = -y(i) (log (f_wb(x)) - (1 - y(i)) log (1 - f_wb(x))
			 	
			 f_wb(x) is the sigmoid function
			
			> Loss is a measure of the difference of a single example to its target value
			> Cost is a measure of the losses over the training set
			
		- Decision bounderies
			g(z) = 0
			w1x1 + w2x2 ... + wnxn + (other polinomials) = 0
				- linear
				- non linear	
				
		- Problem of overfitting:
			-> high bias
			-> high variance	
			
			Solution:
			- More data
			
			- Feature selection
				using just a few features more important to the model
				
			- Regularization
				reduce the size of parameter wj
				
		- Cost function with regularization
			 Chose lambda
